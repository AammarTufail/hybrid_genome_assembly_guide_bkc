## **Bioinformatics ka Chilla** 
> Here is the complete detail about Bioinformatics ka Chilla, [register here](https://codanics.com/bioinformatics-ka-chilla/).   


## Overview

Genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a genome from sequencing reads. This guide demonstrates three approaches:

- **Short-read assembly** (Illumina)
- **Long-read assembly** (Nanopore/PacBio)
- **Hybrid assembly** (combining both)

We use conda environments for reproducible tool installation and provide bash scripts for each analysis step.

---

## Workflow Summary

1. **Download raw reads** (using grabseqs)
2. **Install required tools** (via conda)
3. **Quality control and preprocessing** (FastQC, fastp, NanoPlot, NanoFilt)
4. **Genome assembly** (Unicycler)
5. **Assembly quality assessment** (CheckM2, QUAST, BUSCO)
6. **Genome annotation** (Prokka, Bakta)

---

## Step 1: Download Raw Reads

We use [grabseqs](https://github.com/czbiohub/grabseqs) to download sequencing data from SRA.

### 1.1. Install grabseqs

```bash
# install grabseqs
conda create -n grabseqs -y
conda activate grabseqs
conda install python=3.9 -y
pip install grabseqs
# dependencies
conda install conda-forge::pigz -y
conda install bioconda::sra-tools -y
grabseqs --help
```

### 1.2. Download raw reads

```bash
conda activate grabseqs
# Download Illumina short reads
grabseqs sra -t 4 -m metadata.csv -o ./01_raw_reads/short_reads -r 4 SRR8893090

# Download Nanopore long reads (two runs)
grabseqs sra -t 4 -m metadata.csv -o ./01_raw_reads/long_reads -r 4 SRR8893087
grabseqs sra -t 4 -m metadata.csv -o ./01_raw_reads/long_reads -r 4 SRR8893086

# Download PacBio long reads
grabseqs sra -t 4 -m metadata.csv -o ./01_raw_reads/long_reads -r 4 SRR8893091
```

---

## Step 2: Tool Installation

All required tools are installed using conda environments for reproducibility. The script [`installation.sh`](./installation.sh) automates this process.

### 2.1. Run the installation script

```bash
bash installation.sh
```

This script sets up environments for:

- Short read QC: `fastqc`, `fastp`
- MultiQC for report aggregation
- Long read QC: `NanoPlot`, `NanoFilt`, `Filtlong`
- Assembly: `Unicycler`
- Quality assessment: `CheckM2`, `QUAST`, `BUSCO`
- Annotation: `Prokka`, `Bakta`

It also downloads necessary databases for CheckM2 and Bakta.

---

## Step 3: Data Preparation and Quality Control

All analysis steps are automated in [`analysis.sh`](./analysis.sh). Below, each step is explained.

### 3.1. Rename and organize raw reads

Raw reads are renamed for consistency and directories are created for each analysis stage.

### 3.2. Short Read Quality Control

- **FastQC**: Generates quality reports for raw short reads.
- **MultiQC**: Aggregates FastQC reports for easy review.

### 3.3. Short Read Preprocessing

- **fastp**: Performs quality trimming and filtering of short reads, generating processed files and reports.

### 3.4. Long Read Quality Control

- **NanoPlot**: Visualizes quality metrics for raw and processed long reads.

### 3.5. Long Read Preprocessing

- **NanoFilt**: Filters long reads by quality and length, and crops low-quality bases.
- **Filtlong**: (Optional, commented) Further filters long reads by length and quality.

---

## Step 4: Genome Assembly

- **Unicycler** is used for all assembly strategies:
  - **Short-read only**
  - **Long-read only**
  - **Hybrid (short + long reads)**

Each assembly is output to a separate directory.

---

## Step 5: Genome Quality Assessment

Three tools are used to assess assembly quality:

- **CheckM2**: Estimates completeness and contamination.
- **QUAST**: Provides assembly statistics and gene finding.
- **BUSCO**: Assesses completeness using single-copy orthologs.

Each tool is run on all three assemblies (short, long, hybrid).

---

## Step 6: Genome Annotation

Two annotation tools are provided:

- **Prokka**: Rapid prokaryotic genome annotation.
- **Bakta**: Modern annotation tool with up-to-date databases.

Both tools are run on all assemblies.

---

## Running the Analysis

After installing tools, run the analysis script:

```bash
bash analysis.sh
```

This script will:

1. Prepare directories and rename files
2. Run all QC, preprocessing, assembly, quality assessment, and annotation steps as described above

---

## Script Reference
> Note: Ensure conda environments are activated properly within scripts. and adjust paths as necessary before running.

- [`installation.sh`](./installation.sh): Installs all required tools and databases.
- [`analysis.sh`](./analysis.sh): Runs the full analysis workflow, step by step.

## Notes

- Adjust thread counts (`-t`, `-c`, `-w`) as appropriate for your hardware.
- Ensure all database paths are correct and accessible.
- For BUSCO, download the required lineage datasets as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a conda environment fails to activate within a script, ensure you are using `eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"` at the start of your shell session or script.
- Database downloads may require sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection.
